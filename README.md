### Hello!

- My name is Andrew Thomas, I am currently a junior at Iowa State University studying aerospace engineering and physics. 
- I am involved in machine design, composites, and avionics systems with Cyclone Rocketry at Iowa State. Recently we completed a contract with Honeywell to design and manufacture two identical rockets that would each fly designated payloads twice.
- I am very interested in simulation and optimization. Currently I work for Dr. Ping He at iDesign lab at ISU, developing a series of GUI's for setting up [DAFoam](https://dafoam.github.io/) optimizations. It is called [pvOptGUI](https://dafoam.github.io/mydoc_gui_overview.html).
- In my free time I like to play chess, frisbee golf, and design/build things. I recently built a large CNC router in my parents garage, upgraded with ballscrews the precision is within 0.001"!
